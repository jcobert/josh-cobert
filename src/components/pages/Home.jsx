          <p>
            Thanks for paying me a visit. I am a software developer and creative
            professional. I like long walks on the beach and refactoring code.
            Please check out some of the projects I have worked on and feel free
            to reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
          </p>

      </div>
    </div>
  );
