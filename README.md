# Portfolio Site for Josh Cobert

This is a website to introduce myself and showcase projects I have worked on.

It's a React-based site, bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is styled with the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Feel free to poke around the code, and view the site in action [here](https://joshcobert.com).
